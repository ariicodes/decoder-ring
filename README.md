## Overview

> Welcome to the Decoder Ring, a static site developed to test my ability to engineer complex algorithms and write unit tests using Mocha and Chai.
> Let me guide you through the features, existing files, and setup.

## Relevant Files

- `./src/caesar.js`: Contains algorithm to decipher Caesar Shift.
- `./src/polybius.js`: Contains algorithm to decipher Polybius Square.
- `./src/substitution.js`: Contains algorithm to decipher Substitution Cipher.
- `./test`: Contains tests (caesar, polybius, and substitution).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Run the project at `http://localhost:3000/` or `npm run start`

If you encounter issues, don't hesitate to seek assistance.

## Running Tests
